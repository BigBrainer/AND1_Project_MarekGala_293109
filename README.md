# AND1_Project_MarekGala_293109
My 4th semester android project.

I got approached about a project a while back, so I picked up on it and asked my customer for his requirements.<br>
His vision is to create a small application for martial art clubs (of any kind really), where members of the same club can share and discuss content.<br>
The reason why the customer does not wish to post the content on public platforms is because according to him, there are clubs on the competitive scene which<br>
scour the web for information about their opponents, looking for their weaknesses.<br>
The customer also asked for a martial-art theme in the application for the eye candy. <br>


Requirements (in MoSCoW order)

As a club administrator, I want to be able to create a new club, so that I can establish a platform for sharing content between the members. <br>
As a club member, I want to be able to be able to authenticate using my email or google account, so that there is no mistaking in my identity and strangers won’t be invited accidentally. <br>
As a club administrator, I want to be able to invite and remove members from the club, so that I can manage who is and is not a member of the club. <br>
As a club member, I want to be able to join clubs within the app upon invitation, so that I may see the content in them.<br>
As a club member, I want to be able to post pictures and videos to clubs I am a member of, so that I may share content with clubs I am a member of.<br>
As a club member, I want to be able to post comments on pictures and videos, so that I can share my opinion on them.<br>
As a club member, I want to be able to 'like' or 'upvote' pictures and videos, so that I can let the other members know I like that post.<br>
As a developer, I want the localization to be done both in Slovak and English language, because I intend on deploying the app in Slovakia.<br>
As a club administrator, I want to be able to be able to manage the training schedule, so that I can keep the members up to date on when the club practice takes place.<br>
As a club administrator, I want the members of a club to be able to communicate via instant messaging, so that they can get in contact.<br>

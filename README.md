# AND1_Project_MarekGala_293109
My 4th semester android project.

I got approached about a project a while back, so I picked up on it and asked my customer for his requirements.
His vision is to create a small application for martial art clubs (of any kind really), where members of the same club can share and discuss content.
The reason why the customer does not wish to post the content on public platforms is because according to him, there are clubs on the competitive scene which
scour the web for information about their opponents, looking for their weaknesses.
The customer also asked for a martial-art theme in the application for the eye candy. 


Requirements (in MoSCoW order)

As a club administrator, I want to be able to create a new club, so that I can establish a platform for sharing content between the members.
As a club administrator, I want to be able to invite and remove members from the club, so that I can manage who is and is not a member of the club.
As a club member, I want to be able to join clubs within the app upon invitation, so that I may see the content in them.
As a club member, I want to be able to post pictures and videos to clubs I am a member of, so that I may share content with clubs I am a member of.
As a club member, I want to be able to post comments on pictures and videos, so that I can share my opinion on them.
As a club member, I want to be able to 'like' or 'upvote' pictures and videos, so that I can let the other members know I like that post.
As a developer, I want the localization to be done both in Slovak and English language, because I intend on deploying the app in Slovakia.
As a club administrator, I want to be able to be able to manage the training schedule, so that I can keep the members up to date on when the club practice takes place.
As a club administrator, I want the members of a club to be able to communicate via instant messaging, so that they can get in contact.
